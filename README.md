# ES-6 code examples

Actually, this is a trace of my study adventure with ES-6 (ECMAScript 2015 or ES2015). Formally you will find observations, remarks and some questions here. Will be glad if you will answer them, maybe comment, any communication experience is cool.

My learning was based mainly on this material - [https://babeljs.io/docs/en/learn](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/learn)
and this - [https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/)
and on this - [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)

and this of course [ES-6 features by Luke Hoban](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#enhanced-object-literals)
